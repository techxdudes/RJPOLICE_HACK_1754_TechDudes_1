            <h2>History of Rajasthan Police</h2>
            <p>Rajasthan Police has a rich and glorious history that dates back to the medieval period. The origin of
                Rajasthan Police can be traced to the princely states of Rajasthan, which had their own police forces.
                After the integration of the princely states into the Indian Union in 1949, the Rajasthan Police Service
                was formed by merging the police forces of the former states. The first Inspector General of Police of
                Rajasthan was Shri R. C. Mehta, who took charge on 7 April 1951.</p>
